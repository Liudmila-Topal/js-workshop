/*
Exercise 1:
Simple Promise that Resolves.
- Create a simple Promise that resolves after N seconds with the message "Operation Successful".
- Log the message when the promise resolves.

Expected Output:
Waiting...
Operation Successful
 */
// Create a Promise that resolves after N seconds

// Call the promise and handle the resolution


/*
Example 2:
Fetching Data with Promise.
- Simulate fetching data using a Promise.
- The Promise should resolve with some data (e.g., user information) after an N-second delay, or reject if an error occurs.

Expected Output:
Fetching data...
Data fetched: { name: "Alice", age: 25 }
 */
// Simulate a data fetching Promise

// Call the fetchData function and handle success or failure


/*
Exercise 3:
Sequential Promises (Chaining).
- Simulate a process where multiple asynchronous tasks need to be executed one after another (e.g., multiple API calls).
- Chain multiple promises so that each one starts only after the previous one completes.

Expected Output:
Starting task 1...
Task 1 completed
Starting task 2...
Task 2 completed
Starting task 3...
Task 3 completed
All tasks done!
 */

// Simulate asynchronous tasks using promises

// Chain the promises to run the tasks sequentially
