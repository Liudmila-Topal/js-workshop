/*
Exercise 1:
Calculator with Callback.

Create a simple calculator function that takes two numbers and a callback function to perform an operation:
 - addition
 - subtraction
 - multiplication
 - division on the numbers.
The callback will decide which operation to apply.

Expected Output:
10 + 5 = 15
10 - 5 = 5
10 * 5 = 50
10 / 2 = 2
 */

// Calculator function

// Callback for addition

// Callback for subtraction

// Callback for multiplication

// Callback for divide


/*
Exercise 2:
Counting with setInterval and Callback.
- Create a function that takes a number n and a callback.
- The function will count from 1 to n at 1-second intervals.
- When the count reaches n (can use clearInterval() function), it should call the callback function.

Expected Output:
1
2
3
...
n
Done counting!
 */


/*
Exercise 3:
- Fetching Data with Simulated Delay.
- Create a function that simulates fetching data.
- It should take time and a callback that will handle the result once the "data" is retrieved after a delay.

Expected Output:
Fetching data...
Data fetched: { name: "Alex", age: 17 }
