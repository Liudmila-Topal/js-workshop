Exercise 1:
Sum of Numbers Using a for, while and do...while Loop.
- Write a program that uses a for loop to find the sum of numbers from 1 to 50.
- Do the same task using while and do...while loops.
- Log the result.
*/

//For loop

//While loop

//Do...while loop

/*
Exercise 2:
Find Even Numbers Using continue.
- Write a program that uses a for loop to print all the even numbers between 1 and 20.
- Hint: Use continue to skip the odd numbers.
*/

/*
Exercise 3:
Breaking Out of a Loop.
- Write a program that uses a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 100, but stops when it reaches a number divisible by 25 and is even.

/*
Exercise 4:
Find the First Odd Number Using break.
- Write a program that uses a for...of loop to find the first odd number in an array [2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10]
  and breaks the loop once it finds the odd number.

/*
BONUS:
- Write a program that iterates over the properties of an object containing information about a car using a for...in loop.
1. If the property is year, check if the car is considered "new" (if it's less than or equal to 3 years old).
2. If the property is color, check if the color is blue and log a special message for blue cars.

Input:
let car = {
    make: 'Toyota',
    model: 'Corolla',
    year: 2021,
    color: 'blue'
};

Expected Output:
make: Toyota
model: Corolla
year: 2021 - This car is new.
color: blue - This is my favorite color!
