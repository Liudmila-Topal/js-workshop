/*
Exercise 1:
Simple Async Function.
- Create an asynchronous function that waits for 2 seconds
  and then logs "Task completed!" using 'async' and 'await'.

Expected Output:
Waiting...
Task completed!
 */

// Create a function that returns a promise resolving after 2 seconds

// Use async/await to wait for the promise to resolve

// Call the async function


/*
Exercise 2:
Fetching Data with Async/Await.
- Simulate fetching user data asynchronously.
- Use 'async' and 'await' to wait for the data to be fetched, then log the user information.

Expected Output:
Fetching data...
Data fetched: { name: "Tim", age: 67 }
 */

// Simulate an asynchronous data fetch with a promise

// Use async/await to fetch the data and log the result

// Call the async function to fetch data

/*
Example 3:
Sequential Async Tasks with Delays.
- Create three asynchronous tasks that must be executed in sequence.
- Each task should log a message after a certain delay.
- Use 'async' and 'await' to ensure the tasks run one after the other, with different delays for each.

Expected Output:
Task 1 started...
Task 1 completed
Task 2 started...
Task 2 completed
Task 3 started...
Task 3 completed
All tasks done!
 */

// Simulate an asynchronous task with a promise

// Use async/await to run the tasks sequentially

// Start the sequence of tasks
