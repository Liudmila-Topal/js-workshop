Example 1:
In this example, we will compare String, Number, and Boolean using Greater Than Operator.
 */
console.log("3" > 2);
console.log("2" > 3);
console.log(true > false);
// The String and Boolean values are converted to Numbers and compared.

/*
Example 2:
In this example, we will compare BigInt, and other data types Greater Than Operator.
 */
console.log(2n > 2);
console.log(5n > 4);
console.log(undefined > null);
console.log(null > undefined)
// Similar to the previous example the data type is converted to number and comparison is performed.
