/*
Example 1:
In this example, we will use the exponentiation operator on positive numbers.
 */
let a= 4;
let b= 3;
let c= -2
console.log(a ** b);
console.log(b ** a);
console.log(c ** a);
console.log(a ** c)

/*
Example 2:
In this example, we will try to find the powers of a negative number before assigning it to a variable.
 */
// console.log(-2**3)
/*
Like other languages, JavaScript does not allow a unary operator before exponentiation expression to run this program.
To overcome this problem we will have to put -2 in parentheses like (-2)
